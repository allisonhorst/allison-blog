Hi everyone, I'm Allison! I'm an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where I teach primarily in our [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/) program. My classes include [Essential Math for Environmental Data Science](https://allisonhorst.github.io/EDS_212_essential-math/), [Scientific Programming Essentials](https://allisonhorst.github.io/EDS_221_programming-essentials/), and the [MEDS Capstone course](https://allisonhorst.github.io/EDS_411AB_meds-capstone/) to facilitate student progress on their 6-month group capstone project as a faculty advisor. 

I actively work to contribute to open educational resources, including software for data science education (e.g. the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) R dataset package), and artwork for data science & stats teachers and learners. From 2019 - 2020 I was RStudio's first Artist-in-Residence. You can read more about my motivation in that role in [this blog post](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/artist-in-residence/), and you can find some of my R- and stats-related artwork [in this repo](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations).
