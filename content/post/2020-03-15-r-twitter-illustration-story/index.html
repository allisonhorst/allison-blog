<h3>Walking through the door</h3>
<p>I am always happy to see this illustration used to represent of the welcoming and encouraging #rstats community on twitter. When I drew it, my view was much smaller: I wanted to visualize how Dr. Julie Lowndes (Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/juliesquid">@juliesquid</a>, website: <a href="https://jules32.github.io/" class="uri">https://jules32.github.io/</a>) had gently encouraged me to join twitter for the R community, and the amazement I felt upon opening the door. I was late to the party - finally dipping my toes into the #rstats twitter water in 2018. Two years later, it’s now my go-to place for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staying up-to-date on what’s new in R</li>
<li>Meeting and communicating with new friends and collaborators</li>
<li>Learning new ideas and approaches for teaching stats and data science</li>
<li>Sharing my course materials and artwork</li>
<li>Listening to, and learning from, a diverse range of voices in R/data science/environmental science</li>
</ul>
<p>The rumors are true, people. It’s <strong>the</strong> place to be if you’re learning, using, or teaching R.</p>

<h3>R is better together</h3>
<p>I’ve been teaching stats &amp; data analysis in R at the <a href="http://bren.ucsb.edu/">Bren School of Environmental Science and Management</a> since 2012. But <em>using and teaching R</em> is very different from being a <em>happy R user and teacher</em>.</p>
<p>Frankly, I was a lonely R user flailing around without a home base, and I didn’t even realize how much of a bummer that was.</p>
<p>In 2017, Julie serendipitously moved in to a cabin just one short down the road from me. Do you know what happens when you finally get to hang out with someone who loves using and teaching R as much as you do? <strong>You hang out all the time and never shut up about it.</strong></p>
<p>It’s obnoxious.</p>
<p>We talk about using R on every hike.</p>
<p>We talk about teaching R over bonfires.</p>
<p>We talk about building inclusive R communities while romping with our dogs, Teddy and Khora, in the riverbed.</p>
<p>We talk about R frustrations while eating pizza.</p>
<p>We talk about R at SB R-Ladies (<a href="https://twitter.com/RLadiesSB" class="uri">https://twitter.com/RLadiesSB</a>), UCSB TidyTuesdays, and <a href="https://eco-data-science.github.io/">Eco-Data-Science</a>.</p>
<p>It’s so obnoxious.</p>
